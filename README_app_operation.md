The main program: src/sample/Main.java

When the project is run, there should be no errors on the command line. If there
are, it probably indicates that there is a H2 connection problem. To fix this,
simply start the H2 console, and then close it and try running again.

When there are no errors and a window shows up with 6 buttons displayed
vertically. Click on the top 5 buttons, and it wil take you to another scene
where there is a table and some add, delete, edit, and back buttons. Press the
add button. To add anyting to the properties, sales, or appointmets, there needs
to be customers and employees added. Add some of those first.

When clicking add, there should be a diologue box that pops up with input text
boxes. Add the required information, and click the button "save". You will now
see your entry displayed in the table.

To edit an entry, click on the row desired, and then click the button "edit". A
diologue box will pop up displaying the information in various types of input
based on the table (radio button, text box, drop down list). Make the desired
changes and click save.
